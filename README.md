## Information

Bluelight is built to provide an fast and open source alerting system for
fire departments.

## Technical background

The bluelight frontend uses VueJS, because it is lightweight, powerful and very fast.
We are using Vue in combination with TypeScript, because TypeScript is very scalable
and perfect for projects with a large codebase. 

## Usage

There is an hosted version of Bluelight available on URL, which is easier to use,
because we are maintaining it for you. Nevertheless you can host it yourself. But this
process requires a good knowledge of server administration. Therefore we recommend to
use our hosted version.
